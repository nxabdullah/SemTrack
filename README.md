## Motivation

The driving force behind the conception and creation of SemTrack was the transition challenges from high school to university, experienced during my freshman year at the University of Toronto. As a prospective computer science applicant, a rigorous academic performance was essential for admission into the competitive program. This necessitated constant monitoring and calculation of course averages, which quickly became a tedious task, not just for me but also for my peers. This pain-point inspired me to devise a streamlined solution, a grade tracking system, aimed at simplifying this process and supporting student success.

With SemTrack, the primary aim was to build a solution rooted in simplicity and usability. It was designed to swiftly address a common problem prevalent among my academic community - grade management for strategic course planning. Harnessing the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, SemTrack came to life, eliminating the need for manual grade calculation and providing a user-friendly interface.

Driven by the pride and success of the original SemTrack project, a complete overhaul is now taking shape in this repository. Embracing industry standard technologies such as TypeScript and React, the new iteration aims to preserve the simplicity that made the original so popular while also improving scalability. Reflecting on the past development approach, which relied heavily on traditional web development methods like jQuery, this rejuvenation focuses on implementing best practices of today's software development landscape to deliver a superior and more efficient user experience.
